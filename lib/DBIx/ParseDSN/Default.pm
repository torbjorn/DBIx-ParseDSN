=head1 NAME

DBIx::ParseDSN::Default - A default DSN parser, moose based. You can
use this as is, or subclass it. DBIx::ParseDSN uses this class unless
it finds a better parser.

It can be used directly to parse a DSN, but use instead
L<DBIx::ParseDSN/parse_dsn> which is the intended way to achieve this.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes DBIx::ParseDSN::Default version 0.9.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ## Use it directly:

    use DBIx::ParseDSN::Default;

    my $dsn = DBIx::ParseDSN::Default->new( "dbi:Foo:/bar/baz" );

    ## Subclass:
    {
      package DBIx::ParseDSN::OddBall;

      use Moose;
      extends 'DBIx::ParseDSN::Default';

      sub names_for_database{ return qw/bucket/ }

    }

    package main;

    use DBIx::ParseDSN;

    my $dsn = parse_dsn( "dbi:OddBall:bucket=foo" )

    $dsn->database; ## "foo"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a default DSN parser. It is not specific to any driver. It can
safely be used as a base for driver specfic parsers.

It handles the most common database drivers. See test files for
details.

=head1 DSN ATTIRIBUTES

=head2 database

=head2 dbname

=head2 db

Database attribute of the DSN. See L</names_for_database>.

=head2 host

=head2 server

Server address of the connection. If any. See L</names_for_host>.

=head2 port

Port to connect to on the server. See L</names_for_port>

=head1 OTHER METHODS

=head2 parse( $dsn )

A method used internally. Parses the DSN.

=head2 driver_attr

Any attributes to the driver, ie foo=bar in
dbi:SQLite(foo=bar):db.sqlite. See L<DBI/parse_dsn>.

=head2 driver_dsn

The 3rd part of the dsn string which is driver specific.

=head2 dsn_parts

The 5 values returned by DBI->parse_dsn

=head2 is_local

True if the dsn is local. File based db drivers are local, and network
connections to localhost or 127.0.0.1 are local.

=head2 is_remote

The oposite of is_local

=head2 names_for_database

Name variations for the database attribute. This class uses
qw/database dbname db/.

=head2 names_for_host

Name variations for the host attribute. This class uses qw/host
server/.

=head2 names_for_port

Name variations for the port attribute. This class uses C<port>. This
is included for completeness to follow the pattern used for
C<database> and C<host> but is likely never to be anything other than
just C<port>.

=head2 known_attribute_hash

Combines information for the three above methods to compose a hash
useful for translating names, eg:

    (
      database => "database",
      dbname   => "database",
      db       => "database",
      server   => "host",
      hostname => "host",
    )

This method is mainly for internal use.

=head2 dbd_driver

The perl module driver for this specific dsn. Currently the 2nd value
of the dsn string prefixed by DBD:: , ie DBD::SQLite.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-bug-dbix-parsedsn::parser::default@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
