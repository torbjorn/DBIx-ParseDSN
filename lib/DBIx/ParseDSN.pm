=head1 NAME

DBIx::ParseDSN - Parse DSN's, DBI connection strings.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes DBIx::ParseDSN version 0.9.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DBIx::ParseDSN;

    my $dsn = parse_dsn("dbi:SQLite:database=/var/foo.db");

    $dsn->scheme; ## dbi
    $dsn->driver; ## SQLite
    $dsn->database; ## /var/foo.db

    $dsn->dbd_driver; ## DBD::SQLite

    ## information in user string
    my $dsn2 = parse_dsn( 'dbi:Oracle:host=foobar;port=1521', 'scott@DB/tiger' )
    $dsn2->database; ## DB
    $dsn2->port; ## 1521
    $dsn2->host; ## foobar

    ## uri connector
    my $dsn3 = parse_dsn( 'dbi:Oracle://myhost:1522/ORCL' )
    $dsn3->database; ## ORCL
    $dsn3->port; ## 1522
    $dsn3->host; ## myhost

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Exports parse_dsn that parses a DSN. It returns a
L<DBIx::ParseDSN::Default> that has attributes from the dsn.

This module looks for parser classes of the form DBIx::ParseDSN::Foo,
where Foo literally matches the DSN driver, ie the 2nd part of the DSN
string. Case sensitive.

Example: dbi:SQLite:database=/foo/bar would look for
DBIx::ParseDSN::SQLite and use that as a parser, if found.

If DBIx::ParseDSN::Foo is loaded, it uses that. If the module can be
loaded, it will load it.

It falls back to L<DBIx::ParseDSN::Default> if no specific parser is
found.

To implement not supported DBI driver strings, subclass
L<DBIx::ParseDSN::Default> and reimplement C<sub parse> or change for
example C<sub names_for_database> if database is just called something
else.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 parse_dsn( $dsn );

Parses a DSN and returns a L<DBIx::ParseDSN::Default> object that has
properties reflecting the parameters found in the DSN.

See L<DBIx::ParseDSN::Default/DSN ATTRIBUTES> for details.
